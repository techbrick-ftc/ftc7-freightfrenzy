/*
 * This file is made to be used in the CameraMain class so that the T265 camera and the internal
 * imu do not get instantiated more than once, because keeping them static means
 * THEY PRESERVE THEIR DATA!
 * Isn't that crazy! All this time we had to deal with the camera being reset to 0,0 or the imu
 * axis being reset all to 0, but with keeping that static, it doesn't happen!
 * If you wish to use the camera or imu in OpMode classes, just import and use the get methods and
 * assign that to a variable. For redundancy you can also run the setup methods, but the setup
 * methods are ran inside the CameraMain class, so unless your autonomous class doesn't use the
 * camera, it should already be setup!
